<h1 align="center">Photoelectric Effect Interactive Simulator</h1>

  <p align="center">
    Interactive, web-based simulation of Einstein's Photoelectric for teaching purposes. Users can adjust parameters such as light frequency, brightness, potential difference between plates, and the metal used in the plates.

## Demo
Demo of changing parameters resulting in noticable changes in electron flow inline with [Einstein's Photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect) (frame rate of recording causing blue visual issues, those are not present within application)

## Motivation
My Grade 12 Physics teacher was frustrated when the expensive equipment to demonstrate Einstein's Photoelectric Effect stopped working. The department could not afford to purchase a new one but he still wanted students to be able to learn the concept interactively. He approached me about making this simulation and currently several classes use this simulation for learning about this concept!

## Getting Started 

1. Clone the master branch of this repo with `git clone https://github.com/melekajacob/PhotoelectricEffect.git` 
2. Open `index.html` in your default browser (tested in both Google Chrome and Safari)


## Technologies Utilized
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- p5.js
- Bootstrap

## Roadmap

- [ ] Update JavaScript to ES6
- [ ] Add a wider selection of metals
- [ ] Update simulator to be larger
- [ ] Include more information for users to learn
